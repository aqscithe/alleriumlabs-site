# Game Mechanics & Level Design

This month was all about laying the foundation for **Project Codename: The Facility**. I focused on establishing the core gameplay mechanics and began prototyping the level design that will define the player's experience.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Player Movement System**: Implemented smooth, physics-based movement with proper collision detection
- **Interaction Framework**: Created a flexible system for environmental interactions
- **Level Architecture**: Designed the initial facility layout with interconnected rooms
- **Lighting Pipeline**: Enhanced the lighting system for better atmosphere

## Technical Deep Dive

### Component Architecture

One of the biggest improvements this month was switching to a **component-based entity system**. This architectural change provides several benefits:

```typescript
// Example component structure
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  components: Map<string, Component>;
}

interface MovementComponent extends Component {
  velocity: Vector3;
  acceleration: Vector3;
  maxSpeed: number;
}
```

The new system allows for more flexible entity behaviors and significantly easier debugging. Instead of monolithic game objects, I can now compose entities from smaller, reusable components.

### Physics Integration

The movement system now uses proper physics simulation:

- **Collision Detection**: AABB-based collision with spatial partitioning
- **Movement Dynamics**: Acceleration-based movement with momentum
- **Surface Interaction**: Different surface types affect movement speed

## Level Design Progress

### The Facility Layout

The facility is designed as a series of interconnected rooms, each serving a specific purpose in the narrative:

1. **Entry Hall**: First impression, sets the tone
2. **Main Corridor**: Central hub connecting all areas
3. **Research Labs**: Interactive puzzle areas
4. **Storage Areas**: Resource gathering zones
5. **Control Room**: Climactic final area

### Design Philosophy

The level design follows these core principles:

> "Every room should tell a story, every corridor should build tension, and every interaction should feel meaningful."

- **Environmental Storytelling**: The facility itself tells the story through visual design
- **Progressive Complexity**: Mechanics are introduced gradually
- **Multiple Paths**: Players can approach challenges in different ways

## Visual Progress

Here's what the facility looks like in its current state:

The lighting system creates a moody atmosphere that enhances the survival horror elements while maintaining gameplay visibility.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Performance Optimization

With the new physics system, I encountered some performance bottlenecks:

- **Problem**: Frame drops during complex collision scenarios
- **Solution**: Implemented spatial partitioning and collision culling
- **Result**: Stable 60fps even in complex scenes

### Player Feedback

Getting the movement to feel "just right" took several iterations:

- **Initial**: Floaty, unresponsive movement
- **Iteration 1**: Too stiff, felt robotic
- **Final**: Balanced responsiveness with weight

## Next Month's Goals

Looking ahead to February, the focus will be on:

- **Audio System**: Implementing 3D spatial audio
- **UI Framework**: Creating the in-game interface
- **Save System**: Allowing players to save progress
- **Enemy AI**: First implementation of hostile entities
